1) for some reason I can't put line 8 directly into something like:
Date := date(get(this, "time" + loop1))
it only worked in a variable

let t := this;
for loop1 in range(1, 3) do
	if get(this, "time" + loop1) != null then
		let x := date(get(this, "time" + loop1));
		let newRec := (create DateData);
		newRec.(
			Data := t;
			set(newRec, "Date", x)
		)
	end
end
